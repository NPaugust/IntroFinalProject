The Introduction to CS Final Project.

Pong Game.

Pong is a classic video game created in 1972. 

This game is a best table tennis sport game simulator with 2D graphic. 

The mechanics of the game are 2 squares on the sides of the screen and the ball moving from the blow.

The player must control the square in order to hit the ball moving towards it towards the opponent's side.

If the ball enters the opponent's square, the player gets 1 point.

We used the library "pygame" to create.

Project was made by Adil Ismailov and Avgustin Chynarbekov.
